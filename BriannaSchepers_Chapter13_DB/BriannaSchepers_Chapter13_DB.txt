This program creates a database with population information.Then it calculates the population growth to create a matplotlib plot

Variables:

population - The connection to the database.

i - Iterator for the while loop.

city - User input on what city the SQL query should get data on.

result - The result of the previous SQL query.

Functions:

main - Creates the population_BS database and population table.

population_growth - Calculates a cities population growth based on the population in the population table.

show_population_growth - displays the population growth as a plot based on user input.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly the population_BS is created and the population table is created.

2. Data about cities is then added into the population table.

3. After this the population_growth function is created.

4. A while loop is made to add a new column for every year of growth and then a update statement is used to calculate the growth for each year.

5. Show_population_growth is then created.

6. This function first gets what city the user wants data on and then adds the information in the
   population table into an array to create a matplotlib plot.
