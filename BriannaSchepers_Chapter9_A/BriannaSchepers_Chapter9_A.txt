This program allows the user to enter in banking information and perform basic banking tasks such as withdrawing and depositing.

Variables:

name: Lets the user enter their name for the bank account.

account_number: Lets the user enter their bank account number.

amount: Lets the user enter the balance of their bank account.

interest_rate: Lets the user enter an interest rate for the bank account.

withdrawal_amount: Lets the user enter how much money they want to withdrawal.

deposit_amount: Lets the user enter how much money they want to deposit.

Functions:

test: This function is used to test the methods in the BankAcct class.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly, the BankAcct class is established with an __init__ method that makes sure all instances of the class have the same set of variables.

2. Then the rate change method is made which replaces the old interest rate value with a new one.

3. After this, the withdrawal method is established which lets the user subtract money from the current balance value.

4. The deposit method is then created which lets the user add money to the current balance value.

5. Then the calc_interest method is created which gets an interest amount based on the number of days provided.

6. After this, the test function is created to test the methods in the BankAcct class.
