This program gets user data to create a csv file of grades and displays the data as a table.

Variables:

csv_writer - Used to write information to the csv file.

first_name - Used to store user input of the students first name.

last_name - Used to store user input of the students last name.

exam1 - Used to store user input of the students exam 3 score.

exam2 - Used to store user input of the students exam 2 score.

exam3 - Used to store user input of the students exam 3 score.

csv_reader - Used to read information from the csv file.

Functions:

Write - This function is used to get data and write it to the csv file

Show - Used to display the file in tabular format.

Logical Steps:

1. The first thing done is getting the amount of students the user wants to enter as an int.

2. After that the header for the file is written.

3. Then a for loop is made that gets data for the amount of students entered. At the end of each loop the data is written to the csv file.

4. A new function is then created to display the file previously created as a table.

5. A for loop is created to left adjust every item in a row with spaces in between them.

6. In this for loop items are also separated by lines and columns using a print statement.

7. After this the functions are called and the program ends.
