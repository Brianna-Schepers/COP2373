This program asks the user to input how many movie tickets they want from a preselected amount of tickets. It only allows the user to buy up to 4 tickets at a time and doesn't allow sale when there is not enough tickets.

Variables Created:

TICKETS -- This is the number of tickets that are available for sale.

LIMIT -- This is the limit on how many tickets guests can buy

BUYERS -- This records how many people have bought tickets.


Functions Created:

cinema_tickets -- This is the main function that determines how many movie tickets can be sold and how many have been sold.


Logical Steps:

1. First the program establishes constant variables.

2. A while loop is created that will continue until the tickets reach zero.

3. The user is asked to input tickets and adds one buyer for every loop.

4. An if statement is created to prevent user from buying more tickets than the limit.

5. An elif is created to prevent the ticket count from going below zero.

6. Then an else statement is created that subtracts the amount of tickets bought from the total tickets.

7. After this another if statement is created to end the while loop if the amount of tickets equals zero.
