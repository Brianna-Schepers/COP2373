This program creates a money class that allows for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Variables:
v - The amount of money the user wants to work with.

unit - The type of currency being used.

v2 - The amount the user wants to add, subtract, or multiply by.

Function:
test: Tests the operations of the money class.

Logical Steps:

1. First the money class is established with a __new__ method to allow for the decimal class to be mutable.

2. After this an __init__ method is established to set the amount of money and currency type.

3. Then the addition method is created which allows the user to add money.

4. Step three is repeated but to allow the user to subtract and multiply money respectively.

5. Then the test function is defined to test the operations in the money class.
