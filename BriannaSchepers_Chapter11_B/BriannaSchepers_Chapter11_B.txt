Variables:

angle - The user input on the nearest angle.

length - The user input on the length of the adjacent side.

hypotenuse - The variable that performs the hypotenuse calculation.

Functions:

get_hypotenuse - The main function that performs the hypotenuse calculation.

Logical Steps:

1. First cos and radians are imported from the math package to properly calculate the hypotenuse.

2. Then the user is asked to enter the angle and length variables.

3. After this the hypotenuse is calculated bt dividing the length by the cos of the angle.
   Radians is used to convert the degrees to radians.

4. Then the function displays the hypotenuse using a print statement.
