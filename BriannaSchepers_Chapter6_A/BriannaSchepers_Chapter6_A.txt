This program detects if phone numbers, social security numbers, and zip codes are valid.

Variables:

Functions:

main: The main function that gets user input

phone_valid: Checks the parameter given to see if it is a valid phone number.

ssn_valid: Checks the parameter given to see if it is a valid social security number.

zip_valid: Checks the parameter given to see if it is a valid zip code.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly the phone_valid function is created to check if a phone number is in the valid format.

2. Using regular expressions the formatting is established.

3. An if statement using re.match is then used to determine if the input is valid.

4. These steps are repeated for the ssn_valid and the zip_valid functions.

5. Then the main function is created which calls on the other functions and accepts user input.
