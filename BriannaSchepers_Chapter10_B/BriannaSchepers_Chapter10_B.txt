This program lets the user perform basic money tasks using inheritance.

Variables:

name: Lets the user enter their name for the bank account.

account_number: Lets the user enter their bank account number.

interest_rate: Lets the user enter an interest rate for the bank account.

amount: Lets the user enter the balance of their bank account.

v2 - The amount the user wants to add, subtract, or multiply by.

unit - The type of currency being used.

Functions:

test - Used to test the methods of the BankAcct class.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly the BankAcct class and the Money class from previous projects are added to the program.

2. After that the BankAcct definition statement is modified to inherit the Money class.

3. Then a __new__ method is added into the BankAcct class, so it can use properties from the Money Class.

4. Then the add and subtract methods are added to the BankAcct class using super().
