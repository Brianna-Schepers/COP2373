This program creates a txt document with a list of phrases imitating a 8ball. Then it adds the phrases to a list which it uses to give the user a randomly selected response to a yes or no question.

Variables Created:

cont: This variable is used to determine if the user wants to continue or not.

Functions Created:

eight_ball: Used to create the 8ball_responses.txt file.

main: Used to add the phrases to a list and interact with the user.

Logical Steps:

1. First the program creates a file called 8ball_responses.txt.

2. After this the file.write method is used to add the 8ball phrases to the txt file.

3. Next the main function is created and the cont variable is established.

4. The 8ball file is then assigned the name file to use the line.strip method.

5. Then the line.strip method is used to add each line to the list with no whitespace.

6. After this a while loop is created which uses the pre-established cont variable to get started. Once it is started the user can determine when it ends because the while loop runs as long as cont is "y" or "Y".

7. Then the program asks for user input and uses the random.choice method to display a random item from the list.

8. The user is then asked if they want to continue and an if statement is created to determine if the input is valid.

9. If the user answers n to wanting to continue the program ends.
