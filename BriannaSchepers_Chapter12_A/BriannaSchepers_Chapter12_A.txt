This program uses numpy to perform mathematical functions on information from a csv file.

Variables:

grades - Puts the data from the csv into a numpy array.

passing_grades - Used to calculate the number of passing grades.

failing_grades - Used to calculate the number of failing grades.

Functions:

main - The main function that performs all the operations.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly the csv file is opened and its contents are put into an array.

2. After this a while loop is made to perform operations on the first three exams individually.

3. Then operations are performed on all three of the exams combined.

4. The program then finds the number of passing and failing grades and displays them.

5. Using the data on the passing and failing grades the percentage of passing grades is then calculated.
