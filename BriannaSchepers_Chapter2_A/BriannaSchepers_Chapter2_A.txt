Variables Created:

count: This variable keeps track of the amount of spam words detected


Functions Created:

spam_detector: This function gets user input and determines the chances that the input is spam.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly the empty variables such as spamScore and words are created for later use.

2. After this a list of spam words is created and named spam_words

3. Then the user is asked to enter an email which is converted to all lowercase to get an accurate spam score.

4. A for loop is created that runs for the length of spam_words to count the amount of instances of spam words in the user input.

5. The .count method is used to count the instances in the user input of the item that is at the index of i in spam_words.

6. Then the result of the .count method is added to the spamScore variable.

7. After this an if statement is created to add the item from spam_words if it is found in the user input.

8. Finally, an if statement is created to detect the chance of the user input being spam based on the score.
