This program detects the number of sentences in a string and displays them.

Variables:
count: used to count the number of sentences in the string.

Functions:
main: The main function that is used to count the sentences.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly, the count variable is established to be used later.

2. After that the parameters for what defines a sentence is defined using regular expressions.

3. The first part of the regular expression defines the start of a sentence by a capital letter or a number.
   The regular expression then looks for any punctuation and decides if it's a new sentence by if there is a space and a
   letter or number after the punctuation.

4. Then re.findall is used to detect the amount of sentences in the string.

5. After that a for loop is created to print out each of the sentences.
