This program asks the user to input monthly expenses and tells them the total, highest, and lowest values from the list.

Variables:

cont: Determines if the user wants to keep entering items into the list.

Functions:

Main: This function gets input from the user regarding their monthly expenses and tells them data based off it.

Logical Steps:

1. First two empty lists are created to store the type of expense and cost respectively.

2. Then a while loop is created to get monthly expenses till the user is finished inputting values.

3. After this the user is asked for the type of expense which gets appended to the expense list.

4. The same step is repeated with the cost of the expense to add it to the cost list.

5. Then the reduce method and lambda function are used to get the sum of the cost list.

6. After this the item in the expense list with the same index as the maximum item in the cost list is printed to display the name of the maximum item.

7. A reduce method is used to get the maximum value in the cost list.

8. The last two steps are repeated for getting the minimum value.
