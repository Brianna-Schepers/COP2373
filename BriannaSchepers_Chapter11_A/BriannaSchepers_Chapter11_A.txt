This program allows the user to get a poker hand and redraw cards.

Variables:

numbers - The cards the user wants to replace in the current hand.

numbers_list - A list version of numbers to do operations on.

Functions:

main - The main function to test and use methods in the deck class.

Logical Steps:

1. Firstly I started by putting the pre-established Deck class into my program.

2. After this the redraw method is created to give the user the ability to select new cards.

3. In the method the user is asked to input numbers which are added to a list, so they can be iterated.

4. Then a for loop is created which allows for indexes matching the numbers in numbers_list to be deleted.

5. After this a new card from the deck is added into the cards_in_play_list using the pop method.

6. The cards_in_play_list is returned by the method, so we can display the hand.

7. Skipping over the book code, if we look in the main function a for loop is created to display the hand
   by dividing every value in the cards_in_play_list by 13.
